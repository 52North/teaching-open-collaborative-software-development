# Scrum

Students...
* hesitate to establish required roles as they seem to imply a hierarchy.
* (also good ones) hesitate to take over responsibility (care about exposure).
* are challenged by communication requirements of collaborative software development.
* have to be continuously motivated to adopt an open innovation and development process.

# GitHub

Why use GitHub?
* fast and reliable hosting and source code management platform including issue tracker
* the **GitHub collaboration model** is the most effective one today
  * Fork & Pull: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
  * http://video.esri.com/watch/3223/social-coding-and-the-future-of-open-source
* effective organisation (no emailing code, issue management - see https://education.github.com/)
* web browser access to repositories and the communication "around" code (e.g. on pull requests) allow teachers to give feedback easily and effectively
* transparency

## For Assignments

You can also use GitHub's forking mechanism to hand out assignments and collect assignment submissions.

See https://education.github.com/ for details.

# Organisational

**Students...**
* hesitate to publish code.
* do learn the sense of documentation only at the end of the project.

**Teachers...**
* must stay in touch with new developments and the business world.
* must be ready to interact and participate in the collaboration (during the whole time!).
