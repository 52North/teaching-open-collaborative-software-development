# Learning goals for students

* **Using** open source
  * every real world developer uses some open source library or tool for development
  * students must get to know the typical or common libraries and tools that are used in their or related disciplines
* **Licensing**
  * when you want to use open source software, you need a basic understanding of software licenses and copyright
* **Business models**
  * Learn how you can make a living with open source software.
* **Collaboration**
  * No programmer is an island and works completely alone.
  * The effectiveness of a team depends on their experience and skill in communication and project management as much as it does on their technical skills.
  * Agile software development methods (Scrum, ...)
* **Portfolio**
  * Students can build up an online portfolio showcasing their skills (see also https://education.github.com/).
