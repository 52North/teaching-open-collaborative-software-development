# Teaching Open Collaborative Software Development

## About

This project is about making teaching of software development in the form of projects more effective and efficient. The goals of this are diverse: 

* to improve quality of teaching (method)
* improve the outcomes of software projects (eventually to a level that can be used
* embrace collaborative software development methods (agile manifest, clean code, ...)
* prepare students for latest practices in the industry
* provide a methodology for participants in open source projects to participate in teaching to
  * spread the use of open source tools and libraries
  * conduct software development (e.g. new features, testing) within software development classes
  * recruit contributors (long term, interns, colleagues)

To support people who are either involved in open source software projects or teaching (or both) we want to create **guidelines for teaching collaborative software development with GitHub**.

> The ultimate goal is to increase the quality of software development in project seminars so that geospatial open source software can benefit from (a) direct contributions, and (b) programmers that are acquainted with the “open source way”.

## Focus

* all used tools and texts must be available free of charge or open source
* advanced programming classes (late in BSc, preferably MSc)
* students work in *self-organized groups or teams*, no prepared assignments and tasks
* main learning objective of the course should be programming skills
* collect experiences and provide building stones, don't try to come up with one all-encompassing method 

## How does this work?

As outlined in the core ideas below we will utilize the same collaboration model to develop these guidelines. That means everybody is invited to ...

* create issues on this repository (which we use for task management and discussion),
* fork this repository,
* work on one of the topics or create a new one, and 
* hopefully eventually submit pull requests (which implies you understand and agree to license your contribution as described below). 

## Who does this work?

This project was started in July 2014 by ...

## Subpages

* ``guidelines.md`` is a first draft of ideas how to reach the project goals - **the gist of things**
* ``arguments-oss.md`` lists and links to arguments for using open source software in education
* ``courses-projects.md`` is a hopefully growing list of names of seminars, courses, or projects that applied ideas from this project.
* ``experiences.md`` contains "lessons's learned", tales and stories
* ``learning-goals.md`` discusses what (and why) students can learn based on the guidelines. Just in case you need convincing arguments.
