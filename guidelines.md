# Grading

## ... with GitHub

* require pull requests by all participants of a group
* some quantification possible to encourage use of GitHub
  * minimum # of pull requests opened, merged, closed
  * minimum # of new or closed issues
* require all work, including documentation, to be done one GitHub
  * This allows to value different kind of work, e.g. writing reports or documentation, in the same way as code. Git is a great tool for collaborative writing.

## ... for group work

Students estimate their own contribution to the group very well.

# Agile software development with Scrum

Though there is not necessarily a consensus about what "good Scrum" is, it is relatively clear that for student projects, which are rarely full-time or over periods longer than half a year, some adjustments have to be made to the Scrum process. We see these adjustments as an extension of the Scrum ideals to reflect and improve.

* Using 2 Week long sprints
* Allow virtual stand-ups
* Weekly stand-ups in front of the whole seminar
  * This should be an offer, since an important part of project work is to make your own schedule. If possible teachers should attend these, offer feedback, and invite members of other groups to give feedback.
* Flex up scrum masters: can be the teachers, another group’s member, ...

# Presentations with GitHub

Students have to prepare topics as preparation of the work done in the course.
* The information is the most important thing, therefore require to provide handouts, which are then graded, and give a seperate grad for the presentation of the information itself. See for example https://github.com/Geosoft2/geosoft2-2014-fundamentals.
* Students might also use presentation methods, e.g. based on LaTeX or HTML, that allow them to collaborate on the presentation source file on GitHub.
